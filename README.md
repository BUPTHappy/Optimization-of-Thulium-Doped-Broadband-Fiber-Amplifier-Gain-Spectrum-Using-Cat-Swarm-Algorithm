With the development of light technology, especially the maturation of WDM/DWDM technology, the demand for optical amplification of the S-band and S+ band (1450nm~1520nm) is increasing day by day, and the energy level structure of Tm3+ has energy level transitions to meet the requirements of S-band and S+ band amplification. Although thulium ion has a very complex energy level structure, TDFA is one of the most promising optical fiber amplifiers for S and S+ bands. At the same time, with the continuous development of computer technology and mathematical theory, the optimization algorithm has been rapidly developed and widely used in recent decades, based on genetic algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm, and other traditional optimization algorithms that have been proved to get good convergence speed and optimization results. In this paper, the thulium-doped fiber amplifier's gain is optimized by using a cat swarm intelligent optimization algorithm to obtain the maximum fiber length and doping concentration.
